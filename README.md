#Preface
This project was created for a retro hack day 2018, organised by Schibsted. This project implements
an NES emulator that can be controlled using voice recognition api. Due to low adoption rate of this functionality,
this project will only run in Chrome.

#Running
To start the project, simply run:
- `npm install` to install the dependencies,
- `npm start` to start the server
- go to `localhost:3000` to see the page.
